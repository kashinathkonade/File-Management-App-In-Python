# File-Management-App-In-Python

The File Management App is a Python-based application designed to perform basic file operations such as creating, viewing, deleting, reading, and editing files in a directory. The app is simple, text-based, and interacts with the user via a command-line interface (CLI).

# Features & Functionality

File Creation:
This feature allows the user to create new files in the current directory. The program checks whether a file with the given name already exists to prevent overwriting.

View All Files:
The app lists all files present in the current directory, providing an overview for users.

Delete Files:
Users can remove unwanted files by specifying the file name. It prevents deletion of non-existent files by handling exceptions.

Read Files:
Allows users to open and read the contents of a specified file, making it easy to check file content without using an external editor.

Edit Files:
Users can append new data to an existing file. This provides a simple way to update files without opening them in a separate text editor.
